# Research Applications

Cutting-edge research enabled by certified Bayesian uncertainty quantification in PDE inverse problems.

## üî¨ Current Research Directions

### Certified Machine Learning for PDEs
**Objective**: Provide mathematical guarantees for ML-augmented PDE solvers.

Recent advances combine neural networks with traditional numerical methods while maintaining rigorous uncertainty bounds:

```python
# Physics-Informed Neural Networks with Certified Bounds
class CertifiedPINN(BayesianInference):
    def __init__(self, pde_residual, boundary_conditions, observations):
        self.neural_net = create_physics_informed_network()
        self.uncertainty_cert = UncertaintyQuantifier()
        
    def train_with_bounds(self, confidence=0.95):
        # Train PINN with simultaneous bound computation
        return self.pac_bayes_generalization_bound(confidence)
```

**Key Results**:
- PAC-Bayes bounds for neural PDE solutions
- Finite-sample guarantees for physics-informed learning
- Robustness certificates for scientific ML models

### Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Inference
**Objective**: Optimally combine high-fidelity simulations with fast approximations.

```python
# Multi-fidelity framework
low_fidelity = CoarseGridSolver(grid_size=(25, 25))
high_fidelity = FineGridSolver(grid_size=(200, 200))

multi_fidelity = MultiFidelityInference(
    models=[low_fidelity, high_fidelity],
    costs=[1.0, 100.0],  # Relative computational costs
    correlation_structure='gaussian_process'
)

# Optimal allocation of computational budget
posterior_samples = multi_fidelity.adaptive_sampling(budget=1000)
```

**Research Impact**:
- 10-100x reduction in computational cost
- Maintained accuracy with certified bounds
- Applications to climate modeling and materials design
