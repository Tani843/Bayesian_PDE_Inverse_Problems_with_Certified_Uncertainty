title: "Bayesian PDE Inverse Problems with Certified Uncertainty"
---

## Overview

This framework provides a comprehensive solution for solving inverse problems in partial differential equations using advanced Bayesian methods. It combines rigorous mathematical theory with practical computational tools to deliver certified uncertainty quantification for complex scientific and engineering applications.

### Mathematical Foundation

The framework implements state-of-the-art techniques including:

- **Concentration Inequalities**: Hoeffding, Bernstein, and McDiarmid bounds for finite-sample guarantees
- **PAC-Bayes Theory**: McAllester, Seeger, and Catoni bounds for Bayesian posterior analysis  
- **Advanced MCMC**: Metropolis-Hastings and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with adaptive proposals
- **Variational Inference**: Mean-field approximations with convergence diagnostics

### Key Applications

- Heat transfer and thermal management
- Fluid dynamics parameter estimation
- Material property identification
- Multi-physics coupled systems
- Time-dependent parameter evolution

## Quick Example

```python
import numpy as np
from bayesian_pde_solver import HeatEquationSolver, BayesianInference

# Define 2D heat equation problem
solver = HeatEquationSolver(domain_size=(1.0, 1.0), grid_size=(50, 50))
observations = np.array([[0.5, 0.5, 0.8], [0.3, 0.7, 0.6]])  # [x, y, temperature]

# Perform Bayesian parameter estimation
inference = BayesianInference(solver, observations)
posterior_samples = inference.mcmc_sampling(n_samples=5000)
uncertainty_bounds = inference.certified_bounds(confidence=0.95)

print(f"Estimated thermal conductivity: {np.mean(posterior_samples[:, 0]):.3f}")
print(f"95% certified bounds: [{uncertainty_bounds[0]:.3f}, {uncertainty_bounds[1]:.3f}]")
```
