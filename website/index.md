# Bayesian PDE Inverse Problems with Certified Uncertainty

**A comprehensive framework for solving inverse problems in partial differential equations using Bayesian methods with mathematically certified uncertainty quantification.**

## Abstract

This framework provides a rigorous computational solution for parameter estimation in partial differential equations using advanced Bayesian inference methods. The implementation combines mathematically certified uncertainty quantification with high-performance numerical algorithms for complex scientific and engineering applications.

## Key Contributions

**Mathematical Rigor**: Implementation of concentration inequalities (Hoeffding, Bernstein, McDiarmid) and PAC-Bayes bounds for certified uncertainty quantification with statistical guarantees.

**Computational Efficiency**: Optimized finite difference and finite element PDE solvers with efficient MCMC sampling algorithms and variational inference methods.

**Comprehensive Analysis**: Advanced visualization tools, convergence diagnostics, and statistical validation for thorough analysis of inverse problem solutions.

**Academic Quality**: Publication-ready implementation with extensive documentation, interactive tutorials, and reproducible research examples.

## Technical Framework

The framework implements state-of-the-art techniques including:

- **Concentration Inequalities**: Hoeffding, Bernstein, and McDiarmid bounds for finite-sample guarantees
- **PAC-Bayes Theory**: McAllester, Seeger, and Catoni bounds for Bayesian posterior analysis  
- **Advanced MCMC**: Metropolis-Hastings and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with adaptive proposals
- **Variational Inference**: Mean-field approximations with convergence diagnostics

## Applications

- Heat transfer and thermal management parameter estimation
- Fluid dynamics coefficient identification  
- Material property determination from experimental data
- Multi-physics coupled system analysis
- Time-dependent parameter evolution studies

## Quick Start Example

```python
import numpy as np
from bayesian_pde_solver import HeatEquationSolver, BayesianInference

# Define 2D heat equation problem
solver = HeatEquationSolver(domain_size=(1.0, 1.0), grid_size=(50, 50))
observations = np.array([[0.5, 0.5, 0.8], [0.3, 0.7, 0.6]])

# Perform Bayesian parameter estimation
inference = BayesianInference(solver, observations)
posterior_samples = inference.mcmc_sampling(n_samples=5000)
uncertainty_bounds = inference.certified_bounds(confidence=0.95)

print(f"Estimated thermal conductivity: {np.mean(posterior_samples[:, 0]):.3f}")
print(f"95% certified bounds: [{uncertainty_bounds[0]:.3f}, {uncertainty_bounds[1]:.3f}]")
```
