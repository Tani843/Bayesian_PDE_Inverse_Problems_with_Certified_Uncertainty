# Bayesian PDE Solver

Welcome to the Bayesian PDE framework for inverse problems with certified uncertainty quantification.

## Features
- PDE solvers (finite difference, finite element)
- Bayesian inference (MCMC, variational)
- Certified uncertainty bounds
- Visualization tools

## Quick Start
```bash
pip install bayesian-pde-solver
```
