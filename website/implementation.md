# Technical Implementation

## Architecture Overview

The framework consists of modular components designed for scalability and maintainability:

- **PDE Solvers**: Finite difference and finite element methods
- **Bayesian Inference**: MCMC and variational algorithms  
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Certified bounds computation
- **Visualization**: Publication-quality plotting tools
